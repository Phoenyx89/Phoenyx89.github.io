He did military service during World War I in the Pontonier Corps with the rank of captain, from 1916 to 1918, receiving the Bronze Medal and the Italian Military Cross.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Ponti graduated with a degree in Architecture in 1921 from the Politecnico di Milano University. Also in 1921, he married Giulia Vimercati; they eventually would have four children and eight grandchildren.\r\n\r\nIn 1923 Ponti made his public debut at the first Biennial Exhibition of the Decorative Arts in Monza, which was followed by his involvement in organising the subsequent Triennial Exhibitions of Monza and Milan.\r\n\r\nFrom 1923 to 1930 Ponti worked at the Manifattura Ceramica Richard Ginori, in Milan and Sesto Fiorentino, changing the company's whole output. Other industrial design work includes:\r\n* a line of furnishings for the Rinascente department stores, under the name Domus Nova\r\n* ceramic objects production: maiolica vases, porcelain, sanitaryware (like sinks and toilets (e.g. those created for Richard Ginori and Ideal Standard)\r\n* the preliminary design for Reed & Barton's \"The Diamond\" flatware (1958), adapted for production by designer Robert H. Ramp.\r\n* chairs: among others, he worked for Cassina designing an angular armchair, named \"Distex\", and the very famous 1957 \"Superleggera\" (Superlight) chair, which was very strong but also so light that it could be lifted up by a child using just one finger. Also very famous is the \"Due Foglie\" sofa.\r\n* glass bottles: he designed stylish, colourful glass bottles for various companies such as Venini.\r\n* lamps: for companies such as Artemide, Fontana Arte, and Venini, he created two types of lamps: those provided with very shining, intense colours, and those with a minimalist aesthetic, simple and essential. Among the latter, one of the most famous is the \"Billia\" lamp, which looks modern today while it was designed for Fontana Arte]in 1931.\r\n\r\n_(Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gi%C3%B2_Ponti))_\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Models of interior design\r\n\r\nThe models chosen for the realization are 3. The first is a **Wooden Cabinet** (1953) with protruding strips decorative and functional. The second is an **Armchair** designed in 1953 and built with frame in satin brass and leather two-tone white / blue. The third is one of the most important industrial design products of the twentieth century: the **\"Superleggera\" (Superlight) chair** (1957).\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### Wooden Cabinet\r\n\r\nWooden cabinet with protruding strips (1953) decorative and functional: they served to open doors or drawers. It is part of a series, made ​​with different finishes, including dresser drawers, desks and furniture-bookcase.\r\n\r\n\r\n![wooden cabinet](https://raw.github.com/cvdlab-cg/416886/master/final-project/img/09_Cassettone-per-Triennale-1954_672-458_resize.jpg)\r\n\r\nFor the realization, the model was divided into 3 sections:\r\n\r\n1. Outside\r\n2. Drawers\r\n3. Feet\r\n\r\nThe outside has been created using 5 CUBOIDs 2-dimensional for the outer part. The inner part, instead, has been created using some BEZIER surfaces, joined then with the outer part always through BEZIER.  \r\n\r\n![commode outside](https://raw.github.com/cvdlab-cg/416886/master/final-project/img/commode-outside.png)\r\n\r\nThe drawers has been realized like the outside (with CUBOIDs and BEZIER). For the many strips that appear on the drawers was used the SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEX for each of them. The completed drawers will be then inserted inside the outside.\r\n\r\n![commode drawers](https://raw.github.com/cvdlab-cg/416886/master/final-project/img/commode-drawers.png)\r\n\r\nFinally the feet has been built with a CUBOID as the base, 4 inclined trapezes of different dimension created with SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEX and a cylinder on top. \r\n\r\n![commode-foot](https://raw.github.com/cvdlab-cg/416886/master/final-project/img/commode-foot.png)\r\n\r\nThe entire model is the insertion of these 3 sections into a STRUCT. The following pictures represent the model developed with Plasm.js:\r\n\r\n[![commode1](https://raw.github.com/cvdlab-cg/416886/master/final-project/img/commode1.png)](https://raw.github.com/cvdlab-cg/416886/master/final-project/javascript/commode.js) \r\n\r\n[![commode2](https://raw.github.com/cvdlab-cg/416886/master/final-project/img/commode2.png)](https://raw.github.com/cvdlab-cg/416886/master/final-project/javascript/commode.js)\r\n\r\n Below there is a prototype of the model developed using the python module Pyplasm:\r\n\r\n[![commode py](https://raw.github.com/cvdlab-cg/416886/master/final-project/img/commode_py.png)]\r\n(https://raw.github.com/cvdlab-cg/416886/master/final-project/python/commode.py)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
